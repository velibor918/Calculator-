create html input field and buttons for numbers and operands 

add css only for basic functionality, make pretty later 

Calculator needs to work with 3 + 5 = 15

two variables, operand, and result 

variables and result must be strings in order to appear in input correctly, convert to num in Calculator functions before returning result

make functions that return basic math results for operands(maybe link return value to result var?)
    make seperate variables for operands (varPlus = false varMinus = false etc)
    the functions will just turn these to true on not
    the number buttons will put the value in the second var if these are true, and in the first if false

+ (ab) {return a + b}

- (ab) {return a - b}

* (ab) {return a * b}

/ (ab) {return a / b}

declare three blank variables 

var1 
var2
result
