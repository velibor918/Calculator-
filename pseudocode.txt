create html input field and buttons for numbers and operands 

add css only for basic functionality, make pretty later 

Calculator needs to work with 3 + 5 = 15

two variables, operand, and result 

make functions that return basic math results for operands(maybe link return value to result var?)

+ (ab) {return a + b}

- (ab) {return a - b}

* (ab) {return a * b}

/ (ab) {return a / b}

declare three blank variables 

var1 
var2
result
