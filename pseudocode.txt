create html input field and buttons for numbers and operands  CHECK

add css only for basic functionality, make pretty later CHECK

Calculator needs to work with 3 + 5 = 15

two variables, operand, and result CHECK 

FOR NOW CHECK
    make function that updates varOne string with number and pushes that to input div 
    give function to each number button with foreach 

variables and result must be strings in order to appear in input correctly, convert to num in Calculator functions before returning result

make functions that return basic math results for operands(maybe link return value to result var?)
    make seperate variables for operands (varPlus = false varMinus = false etc)
    the functions will just turn these to true on not
    the number buttons will put the value in the second var if these are true, and in the first if false

+ (ab) {if varplus false make true if true make false}

- (ab) {same logic }

* (ab) same logic 

/ (ab)  same logic 

declare three blank variables CHECK

var1 
var2
result

lets write out some algorithms 
    number buttons increment var1 and change display textContent to var1
    AFTER that an operand button is pressed
        WHEN operand button is pressed, number buttons now increment var2 and display textContent
        is now var2
